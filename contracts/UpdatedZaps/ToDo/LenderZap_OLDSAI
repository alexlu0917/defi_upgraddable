 * The order of field declarations must not be changed, and new fields must be added
 * below all existing declarations.
 *
 * The base contracts and the order in which they are declared must not be changed.
 * New fields must not be added to base contracts (unless the base contract has
 * reserved placeholder fields for this purpose).
